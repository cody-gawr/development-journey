🎙️ **Loom Video Narration Script — "Ad Spend Forecasting Automation"**

---

Hi there,

In this short walkthrough, I’ll show you how we automated ad spend forecasting using APIs, time series models, and Google Cloud tools.

---

**\[0:10 – Data Ingestion Layer]**

First, we pull 24 months of historical ad spend from Google Ads and Meta Ads using their APIs, and optionally, revenue from Amazon or Shopify.

This runs as a scheduled Cloud Function every day, pushing fresh data into BigQuery for storage, and into a Google Sheet for team visibility.

The ETL layer is built to be scalable and resilient — we handle API errors, rate limits, and log everything centrally.

---

**\[0:30 – Forecasting Engine]**

Next, we use Prophet — a time-series forecasting library built for business data — to model seasonal patterns and project the next 12 months of spend.

This model automatically retrains weekly, using the latest data from BigQuery. The goal is to help teams anticipate trends before they happen, not just react to spend reports.

---

**\[0:50 – Anomaly Detection & Intelligence]**

If actual spend deviates too far from forecast — say ±15% — we trigger a Slack alert with the details. This helps spot overspend, underspend, or tracking issues in near real-time.

We can also simulate budget scenarios, like reducing Meta spend or increasing Google, and eventually use a GPT model to explain what’s happening in plain English.

---

**\[1:15 – System Design]**

Here’s how the whole system works:

APIs feed into ETL jobs → BigQuery → forecasting engine → Google Sheet → alerts and summaries. It’s all serverless using Cloud Functions, with optional Cloud Run or Composer for orchestration.

---

**\[1:35 – Why This Matters]**

This moves us from a manual, reactive spreadsheet process to a proactive, intelligent system.

Instead of guessing what next month looks like, we’re forecasting it — and giving teams tools to adjust before things go off track.

Here’s a **2-minute Loom narration script** tailored to your **end-to-end static ad concept generation pipeline**, written in a **clear, technically fluent tone** — ideal for presenting to hiring managers, technical stakeholders, or creative leads.

🎙️ **Loom Video Script — "Automated Static Ad Concept Pipeline Overview"**

---

Hi there, I’m excited to walk you through the ad concept generation pipeline I built — designed to go from a single product page URL to fully structured, Sora-ready ad prompts — completely automated.

---

**\[0:10 – Pipeline Overview]**

The pipeline is made up of 8 modular steps. It’s built using Python, OpenAI models, and optionally Streamlit for QA.

It starts with a product URL — for example, Purdy & Figg’s starter kit offer — and ends with JSON outputs that Sora can directly use to generate static ad creatives.

---

**\[0:25 – Step 1–2: URL Ingest & Product Analysis]**

We accept input via config, CLI, database, or batch CSV — allowing for scalable ingestion across SKUs or brands.

Then we use GPT-3.5 to analyze the product page and extract key brand messaging: tone, value propositions, and differentiators. This replaces manual copywriting research with a fast, reusable prompt layer.

---

**\[0:45 – Step 3–4: Prompt Generation & Concept Output]**

The structured product summary feeds into a Jinja template, creating a consistent prompt for GPT-4o.

This model then generates 10 visually and emotionally diverse ad concepts — each including a scene description, value prop, CTA, and font strategy — designed specifically for Meta Feed and Story formats.

---

**\[1:05 – Step 5–6: Diversity + Tone QA + Sora Formatting]**

Next, we embed each concept using Sentence Transformers to measure semantic similarity and filter out duplicates.

Then we compare each value prop against a brand tone embedding to make sure it aligns with Purdy & Figg’s voice — premium, natural, and elegant.

Each concept is then formatted into a clean Sora prompt that includes visual instructions, font rules, and the product URL for grounding.

---

**\[1:25 – Step 7–8: QA Review + JSON Export]**

Optionally, we use Streamlit to allow a creative lead to approve or reject concepts. Then we export everything into structured JSON — complete with asset references — ready for batch image generation or delivery via API.

---

**\[1:40 – Closing]**

This system transforms what’s usually a manual, creative process into a fully automated pipeline — ensuring speed, consistency, and brand alignment at scale.

Thanks for watching, and feel free to reach out if you want to see the code, sample outputs, or hook this into your own workflow.
