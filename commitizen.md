Absolutely! As a **professional Angular developer**, following a clear and standardized **Git commit message convention** is essential ‚Äî especially when working on large teams or using tools like **Semantic Release**, **Conventional Changelog**, or **commitlint**.

Angular projects typically follow the **Conventional Commits** format, which is well-structured and widely used.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Guide: Angular Git Commit Message Convention

---

### üìå 1. **Commit Message Format**

```text
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

<body>

<footer>
```

All sections are **plain text**, no Markdown.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Allowed `<type>` Values**

These are the most common types used in Angular (and most TypeScript/JS projects):

| Type       | Purpose                                                               |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | A new feature                                                         |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                                             |
| `docs`     | Documentation only changes                                            |
| `style`    | Formatting (tabs, spaces, semicolons, etc), no code changes           |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature               |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                                               |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                                              |
| `build`    | Changes that affect build system or dependencies (npm, webpack, etc.) |
| `ci`       | Changes to CI/CD config (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, etc.)              |
| `chore`    | Routine tasks, maintenance (e.g., updating deps, cleaning logs)       |
| `revert`   | Revert a previous commit                                              |

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Optional `<scope>`**

Use it to specify the area of code affected.  
It can be a module, component, service, or tool name.

Examples:

- `feat(auth): add login form`
- `fix(core): handle null values in config`
- `docs(readme): update getting started section`

> ‚úèÔ∏è **Rule of thumb**: Use scope if it helps narrow down context.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Subject (short description)**

- **Max 50‚Äì72 characters**
- **Use the imperative mood**: ‚Äúadd‚Äù, ‚Äúfix‚Äù, ‚Äúrefactor‚Äù, not ‚Äúadded‚Äù or ‚Äúfixes‚Äù
- **No period at the end**

‚úÖ Good:

```text
feat(router): add dynamic route handling
```

‚ùå Bad:

```text
added dynamic route handler.
```

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **Body (optional but recommended)**

Use the body to:

- Explain _what_ and _why_, not _how_
- Use full sentences
- Wrap lines at 100 characters

Example:

```text
feat(user): add email verification feature

This update adds backend logic for generating one-time codes and a new
UI modal for verification. It improves account security and will be
required before beta release.
```

---

### ‚úÖ 6. **Footer (for breaking changes and issue links)**

#### üî• Breaking Change:

Start with `BREAKING CHANGE:` and describe what‚Äôs breaking.

```text
BREAKING CHANGE: auth interceptor no longer injects authToken automatically.
Use AuthService.getToken() instead.
```

#### üß© Linking Issues:

Use `Closes`, `Fixes`, `Refs`, etc.

```text
Closes #42
Refs #99
```

Full example:

```text
feat(auth): add email login support

Added new login method using email link. This provides an alternative to password login
for increased accessibility and password-less flows.

BREAKING CHANGE: removed legacy passwordLogin() method
Closes #102
```

## üí° Pro Tips

- Use tools like [`commitizen`](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) for guided commit prompts.
- Integrate [`commitlint`](https://commitlint.js.org/) to enforce rules via Husky.
- Use commit messages to generate changelogs automatically with [`standard-version`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) or Semantic Release.

Here's a professional yet practical guide for making a **GitHub commit for a work-in-progress (WIP) change**, tailored to you as a **Senior Software Engineer**.

---

## ‚úÖ Guide: WIP Git Commit ‚Äì Senior Engineer Style

### 1. **When to Make a WIP Commit**

Use a WIP commit when:

- You want to save your current progress but the work isn't ready for review.
- You're switching contexts or ending the workday.
- You need feedback on an incomplete solution.
- You're collaborating and want others to see what you're working on.

---

### 2. **WIP Commit Message Format**

Here‚Äôs a format that reflects clarity and senior-level professionalism:

```
WIP: [Scope] Brief description of progress

What‚Äôs done:
- List completed elements or changes.

What‚Äôs pending:
- List items still to do.
- Optional: blockers or questions.

Notes:
- (Optional) Any warnings, important context, or links to discussions/issues.
```

---

### 3. **Example Commit Message**

```
WIP: auth module ‚Äì setup login flow and initial form validation

What‚Äôs done:
- Created login component and form.
- Added reactive validation for email/password.
- Started integrating AuthService with form.

What‚Äôs pending:
- Hooking up actual HTTP API.
- Handling error messages from backend.
- Unit tests.

Notes:
- Blocking on backend team to finalize login endpoint (ETA tomorrow).
```

---

### 4. **Best Practices**

- **Prefix** with `WIP:` so others know not to review/merge it.
- **Push to a feature branch**, not `main`.
- **Rebase/squash** these commits later before merging.
- **Keep commits atomic**‚Äîdon‚Äôt mix unrelated changes.
- **Write in plain English**‚Äîclear communication is key at a senior level.

---

### 5. **Bonus Tip: Use Commit Templates**

You can create a `.gitmessage` template to make this process quicker:

```txt
WIP: [Module/Feature] short summary

What‚Äôs done:
-

What‚Äôs pending:
-

Notes:
-
```

Then set it globally:

```bash
git config --global commit.template ~/.gitmessage
```
