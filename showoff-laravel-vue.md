### üéôÔ∏è **Video Script ‚Äì Soundblock Project (Laravel + Angular)**

---

**Hi there!**
I'm Lautaro, a senior full-stack developer with around 7 years of hands-on experience building scalable web platforms. Today, I‚Äôd like to walk you through one of the key projects I worked on ‚Äî **Soundblock**, a platform developed using **Laravel (PHP)** on the backend and **Angular** for the frontend.

---

### üß© **Project Overview**

Soundblock is a **music asset management platform** tailored for creators and producers. It allows users to upload, organize, and monetize music-related content in a secure and automated environment.

The system handles **user authentication**, **role-based access**, **payment integration**, and **background processing** for handling heavy file operations like zipping and unzipping music files.

---

### üóÇÔ∏è **Core Functionalities**

Here are a few key modules and how they‚Äôre structured:

- **Apparel Module**:
  Allows users to list and manage merchandise. It‚Äôs tightly integrated with product inventory and custom order tracking.

- **Arena Office Dashboard**:
  Built for artists and managers to track revenue, payouts, and royalties. We used Laravel's Eloquent ORM to design normalized MySQL schemas and efficient data access.

- **Authentication System**:
  We implemented Laravel Passport for API authentication, allowing secure token-based access for different roles ‚Äî like artists, collaborators, and admins.

- **Payment Integration**:
  Stripe was used to handle both one-time purchases and recurring subscriptions. I integrated webhook listeners to handle real-time payment updates and errors.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Background Tasks & Queue Workers**

One of the heavier features in Soundblock was the **file processing workflow**:

- When a user uploads a project, it‚Äôs stored as a **.zip archive**.
- A Laravel queue job is dispatched using **Supervisor and Redis** to extract the zip in the background ‚Äî ensuring no delay for the user.
- After extraction, we trigger a notification system (via email or in-app alerts) to inform the user that their content is ready.
- This setup helps with **asynchronous processing** and keeps the frontend responsive, especially for large files.

---

### üóÉÔ∏è **Schema Design**

Our MySQL schema was carefully normalized and optimized. I created ERDs for each major domain ‚Äî including Users, Projects, Assets, and Financial Transactions. We used foreign keys and indexed pivot tables to optimize relationship lookups, especially for reporting and dashboard modules.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Frontend with Angular**

On the frontend, we used **Angular 8 with NgRx** to manage state and **Material Design** for the UI layer. I designed reusable components for project uploads, dashboards, and notifications.

---

### üí° **Challenges Faced**

- One challenge was handling **large zip file processing** without blocking the user. We solved this with proper queueing and notification feedback loops.
- Another was integrating the **Stripe payment system** for both platform fees and artist payouts. We had to ensure secure, idempotent API calls and solid error handling.

---

### ‚úÖ **Outcome**

The platform now supports thousands of users and handles large file uploads with confidence. I‚Äôm proud of how we made it scalable, secure, and easy to use.

---

### üéôÔ∏è **Narration Script for `CategoriesController.php` (Laravel + DI + Services)**

---

Hi again ‚Äî now I‚Äôll walk you through a real-world controller from the Soundblock project. This is the `CategoriesController` located in the Apparel domain. It's part of a modular Laravel application and follows clean architecture principles like **Dependency Injection**, **service-oriented design**, and **separation of concerns**.

---

### üì¶ Controller Overview

This controller is responsible for handling **Apparel Categories**, including:

- Listing categories
- Fetching products under a category
- Fetching related attributes (like color, style, fit)
- Providing a bootstrap response with product and slider data for the frontend

We follow a **thin controller** approach ‚Äî the controller acts as a bridge between the request and dedicated **service classes**, which handle the business logic.

---

### üß± Dependency Injection

In the constructor, we inject the `Category` and `Attribute` models directly:

```php
public function __construct(Category $category, Attribute $attribute)
```

These are used primarily for simple lookups or fallbacks.

In more complex methods like `getProducts`, we inject service classes like `ProductService`, `AttributeService`, or `CategoryService` **as method parameters**, which Laravel resolves automatically thanks to its built-in **IoC container**.

---

### üîç Fetching Products for a Category

In the `getProducts` method:

```php
$category = $categoryService->find($categoryUuid, true);
$filters = $request->only(["color", "style", "weight", "fit"]);
$products = $productService->getProductsByCategory($category, $filters, $request->get("per_page", 20));
```

We:

1. Use `CategoryService` to find the category by UUID.
2. Extract relevant filter parameters from the request.
3. Delegate business logic to `ProductService`, which handles the filtering and pagination.

The result is returned through a standardized API resource (`BaseCollection`), which formats the response consistently across endpoints.

---

### üì¶ Pagination Logic

In the `__getProducts` method, we manually paginate the product list using Laravel‚Äôs `LengthAwarePaginator`:

```php
new LengthAwarePaginator(
  $products->forPage(...),
  $products->count(),
  ...
)
```

This was needed because `getProductsByCategory` returns a `Collection`, not a paginated query ‚Äî likely due to additional in-memory filtering.

---

### üéØ Bootstrap Method

The `bootstrap()` method prepares default data for the frontend, including featured products and **slider images** stored on Amazon S3.

```php
$sliderImages = [
  $apparelAdapter->url("slider/1.webp"),
  $apparelAdapter->url("slider/2.webp"),
];
```

We use a custom S3 disk (`s3-apparel`) and expose public URLs for use in the frontend carousel. This shows how we integrate cloud storage directly into the app.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

Each method is wrapped in a try-catch block:

```php
try {
  // logic
} catch (\Exception $e) {
  throw $e;
}
```

In production, we usually log the error or return a custom API error response. But for now, this simple rethrow is enough to indicate that proper error boundaries are in place.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

This controller shows a clean and scalable design using:

- **Constructor & method-level Dependency Injection**
- **Service classes for business logic separation**
- **Pagination and filtering**
- **S3 integration**
- **Typed responses and API resources**

It‚Äôs structured to be testable, easy to maintain, and fits well into a larger domain-driven Laravel app.

Absolutely! Here's a **clean, professional, senior-level narration script** you can use to explain the `PaymentsController` for your video presentation. This version focuses on showcasing your experience with **Laravel best practices**, **Stripe integration**, **contracts (interfaces)**, **error handling**, and **secure payment flow** ‚Äî all of which reflect your capability as a senior Laravel developer.

---

### üéôÔ∏è **Narration Script ‚Äì `PaymentsController` (Laravel + Stripe Integration)**

---

Let me now walk you through a core component of the **Soundblock platform** ‚Äî the `PaymentsController`, which manages Stripe-based payment operations.

This controller demonstrates my experience in building **secure, scalable, and testable** payment workflows in Laravel using a **contract-driven architecture** and **third-party integrations**, in this case, Stripe.

---

### üîê Key Design Highlights

- We use **Laravel Contracts** (`PaymentContract`, `FinanceContract`) to **decouple business logic** from the controller.
- All Stripe logic is encapsulated within services, which follow the **Dependency Inversion Principle** ‚Äî making them easy to mock and test.
- We follow a **defensive programming style** by catching and handling multiple exception types, providing robust API error responses.
- The controller methods are well-documented using Laravel-style annotations for API documentation (e.g., `@group`, `@responseFile`, `@bodyParam`).

---

### üí≥ `addPaymentMethod()`

```php
public function addPaymentMethod(AddPaymentMethodRequest $request, PaymentContract $payment, FinanceContract $financeContract)
```

This method adds a Stripe payment method for the authenticated user and **immediately charges** them using our internal `FinanceContract`.

Key steps:

1. Get or create a Stripe customer for the user.
2. Add a new payment method via Stripe.
3. Charge the user immediately to validate the method (e.g., \$1 authorization or first payment).
4. Catch and handle any exceptions: `CardException`, `InvalidRequestException`, or a custom `PaymentTaskException`.

We use Laravel‚Äôs built-in `Auth` facade to retrieve the authenticated user and a custom FormRequest (`AddPaymentMethodRequest`) for validation.

---

### üßæ `getPaymentMethods()`

This method retrieves all saved Stripe payment methods for the user:

```php
$user->asStripeCustomer();
return response()->json($payment->getUserPaymentMethods($user));
```

We ensure the user is a Stripe customer before fetching their methods, otherwise, we abort with a clear error message. This helps **maintain API consistency** and guides the frontend in handling empty or invalid states gracefully.

---

### ‚ùå `deletePaymentMethod()`

This method handles two flows:

- If no method ID is passed, **all payment methods are deleted**.
- If a specific method ID is passed, only that one is removed.

We validate ownership and existence of the payment method using `findPaymentMethod` on the user model. This protects against ID spoofing and ensures **secure access control**.

---

### ‚≠ê `updateDefaultPayment()`

This method updates the **default payment method** for the user:

```php
$payment->updateDefaultMethod($user, $methodId);
```

We again validate ownership of the method, retrieve the customer on Stripe, and then update the default method. This keeps billing consistent across subscriptions or one-time charges.

---

### üß† Error Handling Strategy

All methods implement **structured exception handling**, catching:

- Stripe-specific exceptions (`CardException`, `InvalidRequestException`)
- Custom app-level exceptions like `PaymentTaskException`
- Fallback to a generic exception block with a clean API response

In the case of critical failures, we use a custom `Disaster::handleDisaster()` to log and alert developers or external monitoring tools.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

This controller represents a **modular, secure payment handling system** using:

- Contract-driven design
- Laravel's Auth, Request Validation, and Facade features
- Stripe SDK integration
- Clear separation of controller and service logic

It‚Äôs built to be **scalable**, **testable**, and **safe**, and has been used in a production environment to manage real user payments with confidence.

Here‚Äôs a **natural and technically clear narration script** to help you explain the **ERD schema** based on the tables you've shared ‚Äî particularly focusing on `users` and `users_financial_stripe_subscriptions`.

---

### üéôÔ∏è **Narration Script: Explaining the ERD (Laravel + Stripe Subscription Model)**

> ‚ÄúLet me now walk you through a part of the database design behind Soundblock ‚Äî specifically around **user accounts and Stripe subscriptions**.
>
> At the center of this schema, we have the **`users` table**, which stores core user identity information. It includes fields like:
>
> - A primary key `user_id`,
> - A globally unique identifier `user_uuid`,
> - Standard name fields like `name_first`, `name_middle`, and `name_last`,
> - As well as secure password storage and token-based authentication.
>
> Now, each user can have one or more subscriptions through Stripe. These are handled in the **`users_financial_stripe_subscriptions`** table.
>
> This table links back to the users table using both the `user_id` and `user_uuid` for redundancy and security ‚Äî which allows us to join and filter records either by auto-increment IDs or UUIDs in a secure, API-friendly way.
>
> For each subscription, we store:
>
> - The `stripe_id`, which maps directly to Stripe‚Äôs internal reference
> - The `stripe_status` such as `active`, `trialing`, or `canceled`
> - The `stripe_plan` name or tier
> - The number of licenses or seats in `quantity`
> - And timestamps for trial expiration (`trial_ends_at`) and subscription end (`ends_at`)
>
> Additionally, we use custom timestamp fields like `stamp_created`, `stamp_updated`, and `stamp_deleted`, alongside Laravel‚Äôs native timestamps. These allow for **audit logging** and tracking which system user performed each change ‚Äî helpful when integrating with **ledger systems like AWS QLDB** for full traceability.
>
> All major fields are indexed to ensure performance during reporting, dashboard views, and filtering subscription data by status or date.
>
> This structure makes it easy to join users with their financial activity, and supports scalable subscription logic for future integrations ‚Äî like webhook handling, invoicing, or analytics.
>
> Overall, this ERD gives us a flexible and secure foundation for managing Stripe-based billing in the Soundblock ecosystem.‚Äù

### üéôÔ∏è **Narration Script: Explaining the ERD ‚Äî Apparel + Stripe Subscriptions**

> ‚ÄúLet me now walk you through two distinct parts of our schema design ‚Äî one related to **Stripe subscriptions for users**, and another focused on **attribute-category relationships** for our apparel system.
>
> First up, we have the **`users_financial_stripe_subscriptions`** table. This table captures Stripe-based subscriptions linked to each user.
>
> It stores both a numeric `subscription_id` and a UUID `subscription_uuid` to support both internal DB references and external API communication.
>
> We reference the user in two ways ‚Äî by `user_id` and `user_uuid` ‚Äî and keep detailed subscription metadata like the Stripe ID, plan name, status, quantity, and trial/expiration timestamps.
>
> This table also includes **audit timestamps**, like `stamp_created`, `stamp_updated`, and `stamp_deleted`, along with the corresponding `created_by`, `updated_by`, and `deleted_by` fields. These are useful for tracking system-level activity, especially in an environment like AWS QLDB where historical integrity matters.
>
> Now let me switch gears to the more complex **`apparel_categories_attributes`** table.
>
> This is a **many-to-many relationship table** that links **apparel categories** to **custom attributes** ‚Äî for example, connecting a "T-Shirt" category with attributes like "Size", "Color", or "Material".
>
> Each record has a unique `row_id` and `row_uuid`, and it links to both `attribute_id` / `attribute_uuid` and `category_id` / `category_uuid`.
>
> What's especially important here is that we‚Äôve defined **multiple composite unique constraints**. These prevent duplicate relationships between attributes and categories in any order or combination ‚Äî making sure our data model is clean and consistent.
>
> This is critical in a system where we generate dynamic product variations and need full control over which attributes apply to which categories.
>
> Just like with subscriptions, we include full timestamp tracking and user stamps for creation, updates, and deletions.
>
> Overall, this schema shows how we designed Soundblock‚Äôs backend for **data consistency, traceability, and flexibility**, while keeping it optimized for real-world scale and integrity.
>
> Thanks for watching!‚Äù
